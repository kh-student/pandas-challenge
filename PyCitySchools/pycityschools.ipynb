    "## PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "###### This analysis displays metrics taken from 15 different high schools and cross referencing two key factors: budget and test scores across schools and students. Two separate data frames were given: a data frame for school information and a data frame for student information. These two date frames were inner merged into one data frame, then subsequently analyzed. The data was first analyzed at a high level into a district summary, then, the data was grouped by schools and school specific data was analyzed further by various characteristics. The following conclusions were drawn from this data analysis:\n",
    "###### 1. Larger high schools consisting of between 2000-5000 students appear to perform worse in math and reading overall than high schools with less than 2000 students. In reference to the data frame organizing data by school size, the average math scores, reading scores, and average passing rates across students are notably lower in large high schools (2000-5000 students) than medium (1000-2000 students) and small (<1000 students) high schools. (See Cell 41) \n",
    "###### 2. Students from charter high schools appear to perform better in math and reading overall than students from district high schools. In reference to the data frame organizing data by type of school, the average math scores, reading scores, and average passing rates across students are notably higher in charter schools than district schools. (See Cell 44) This may suggest that "
